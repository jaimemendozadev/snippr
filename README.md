- Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.
- Once npm is installed, run the following commands in separate Terminal tabs:
  - `$ npm install` to install the npm dependencies in the `package.json` file. 
  - If you need seed/dummy data in your database, run `$ npm run seed`.
- Set a `PORT` variable in your .env file

- Run `$ npm start` and navigate to [http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT]/](http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT]/) on your favorite web browser to be directed to the login page.
  - On the landing page to Snyppr, you'll have the option of either signing up as a Snyppr (a barber) or as a Snypee (a client that's looking for a haircut).

### APIs You Will Need
- Make an account and replace the public key in the code with yours
  - Auth0
  - Stripe
  - Google Maps Geocoding and Places APIs

## Deploying
- Deploy to aws and add the following keys to your .env file with these variable names: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - Or your choice of hosting service and replace the aforementioned variables in the code.

## Current Snyppr issues

- Here are some bugs we are aware of:
  - If Snyppr signup is interrupted before you can make a Stripe account, you can't use that account because of the current routing logic.
  - Any post to the database does not trigger a rerender and will not be reflected in the UI until you refresh.
  - Sockets sent payment request to all connected channels instead of just one channel.
